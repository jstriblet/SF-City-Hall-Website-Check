# SF-City-Hall-Website-Check

This is a small shell script to pull down the SF City hall website to check to see if there's been any updates regarding
acceptances of new reservations or lifting of restrictions put in place because of COVID-19.

You will also need a LunchD/Cron Job/Automator configured for your script to run automatically.
